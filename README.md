# Dingers VR Homerun Derby 

#### Virtual Reality Baseball Game 

##### Developed for SteamVR using Unity 2017.1.1fd
###### First read me with updated ui

Dingers VR is a arcade style batting game. The current game mode is Homerun Derby. 

The player has a switchable bat thatcan be swung to hit the balls that are thrown 
by a pitching machine. The ball can be hit and will react to the field according to 
the normal in play rules of baseball. 

 - Hitting the ball
 - swinging and missing
 - foul balls
 - base hits
 - home runs
 - ground rule doubles
 - and upcoming special triggers 
 
Each of these options will result in a different score. Next I will create a node based 
Radial UI that will be navigable thru settings, game modes, and non linear bat options.
The special triggers will be expanded as well.
